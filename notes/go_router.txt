Navigation and routing with GoRouter

https://pub.dev/packages/go_router

Goals:
    Learn about declarative routing
    Become familiar with GoRouter APIs
    Migrate existing app from Nav 1.0 to GoRouter
    Learn a few tricks along the way


Section Outline:
    Navigator 1.0 and its limitations
    How Navigation 2.0 (Router API) solves this
    Why GoRouter is 'better' than Navigator 2.0
        Install & configure GoRouter
        Work with routes and sub-routes
        Navigation using 'go' and 'push'
        GoRouterHelper extension
        Routing with parameters & error handling


    
Navigator 1.0 and its limitations:
    Could all routes be defined in one place?
        (important as the app becomes bigger)
    
    Named Routes solve this problem https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation/named-routes
        Benefit: Centralize all route definitions in one placd
        Easier to manage as the app becomes bigger

    
    
Routing by URL and redirects are the 'normal' way of doing navigation on web
    Only available with flutter routing APIs (Navigator 2.0)
    also needed for Deep Linking

    Navigator 2.0 is very capable
        But hard to use and doesn't scale well


Andrea recommend GoRouter:
    Minimal, easy to use API
    Outstanding documentation
    Maintained by the Flutter team

We have 2 options

    1, Implement RouterConfig by hand
    2, Use GoRouter instead

We can migrate from Navigator 1.0 to GoRouter incrementally!
